TO DO:
6) implement on-commit and on-rollback (idea from SW-STM)
   what if functions registered with on-commit fail?
   Isn't it too late to rollback?

5) contact Lars Rune Nostdal <larsnostdal at gmail dot com>, author of SW-STM:
   see http://blog.nostdal.org/
   "I have a very crude and quite horribly written one laying around for
    Common Lisp: https://github.com/lnostdal/SW-STM"

4) orelse and nested transactions

DONE:
3) (error 'retry-error ...) should show message "attempt to RETRY outside ATOMIC block"
   when printed
2) in atomic.lisp (run-once) add handler-case to capture errors signaled by tx
1) implement ($ tvar) and (setf ($ tvar) value)
   for transactional access to tvars.
   useful when dealing directly with tvars,
   for example in cases transactional objects are too heavyweight
