TO DO:
4) orelse and nested transactions

DONE:
3) (error 'retry-error ...) should show message "attempt to RETRY outside ATOMIC block"
   when printed
2) in atomic.lisp (run-once) add handler-case to capture errors signaled by tx
1) implement ($ tvar) and (setf ($ tvar) value)
   for transactional access to tvars.
   useful when dealing directly with tvars,
   for example in cases transactional objects are too heavyweight
