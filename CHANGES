Changes in STMX 1.9.0:
* Added support for hardware transactions on CPUs that support Intel
  Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX)
  
* Implemented global clock API and implementations for GV1, GV5, GV6.
  The latter still needs to be optimized.

* Small API change: renamed $ and (SETF $) to $-SLOT and (SETF $-SLOT) respectively.
  They behaves as before the rename: ($-SLOT VAR) signals an error if VAR is unbound.

  The functions $ and (SETF $) still exist but now have slightly different - and faster -
  behaviour: if VAR is unbound, ($ VAR) returns +UNBOUND-TVAR+ instead of signaling an error.
